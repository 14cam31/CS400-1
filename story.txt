Today's the worst day of my life! I got 1 / 10 on the vim activity for no reason! I submitted everything, and apparently my submission says that I only edited lesson 5.3! 
This makes no sense! If I would do the assignment I would do it sequentially right! Why would I "randomly" scroll down to 5.3! Man, I hate my life.... :( Anyways, I contacted Dr. Florian about this issue, let's see what he says!
